I"æ<p>Race and culture, especially in a country that prides itself on being a mixing pot, has never been a dichotomy, yet too often in America itâ€™s treated like one: you are one thing or another, Black or White, Asian or White, Us or Them. Increasingly, as every issue becomes an issue of race, people are forced to pick a sideâ€”a recent example being how the debate over re-instating Affirmative Action in the University of California system has been cast as an Asian vs. Other Minorities or White vs. Minorities issue. Being forced to pick a side is never easy, and itâ€™s worse for people who cannot pick a side because they donâ€™t belong to any one side. 1 in 7 babies born in 2015 were multiethnic (Pew Research study), and that number has only grown with time. When these students go to school or life, they find themselves stuck with choosing to suppress part of their cultural background to fit it with a group: to choose one ethnic club, to choose one friend group, etc.</p>

<p>From our conversations with many students in this situation, we have found that the fundamental struggles of being all mixed up transcend studentsâ€™ specific backgrounds: to varying extents, we all feel conflicted, we all feel boxed in by a system that doesnâ€™t like to acknowledge us, and people frequently guess our races or cultural backgrounds wrongly. Some of us regret not learning more about one of our parentâ€™s cultures; some of us feel guilty about not <em>wanting</em> to learn more about our cultures.</p>
