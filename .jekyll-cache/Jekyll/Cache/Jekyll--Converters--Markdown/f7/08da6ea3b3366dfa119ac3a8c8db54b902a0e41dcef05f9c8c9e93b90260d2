I"<p>Race and culture, especially in a country that prides itself on being a mixing pot, has never been a dichotomy, yet too often in America it’s treated like one: you are one thing or another, Black or White, Asian or White, Us or Them. Increasingly, as every issue becomes an issue of race, people are forced to pick a side—a recent example being how the debate over re-instating Affirmative Action in the University of California system has been cast as an Asian vs. Other Minorities or White vs. Minorities issue. Being forced to pick a side is never easy, and it’s worse for people who cannot pick a side because they don’t belong to any one side. 1 in 7 babies born in 2015 were multiethnic (Pew Research study), and that number has only grown with time.</p>
